The Health Prediction system is an end user support and online consultation project. Here we propose a system that allows users to get instant guidance on their health issues through an intelligent health care system online. The system is fed with various symptoms and the disease/illness associated with those systems. The system allows user to share their symptoms and issues. It then processes users symptoms to check for various illness that could be associated with it. Here we use some intelligent data mining techniques to guess the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient\\u2019s symptoms. If the system is not able to provide suitable results, it urges users to go for blood test, xray, citi scan or which ever report it feels user\\u2019s symptoms are associated with, so next time user may be able to login and upload an image of those reports.
